# deb-dr #
This project will result in a cli option that can be used to create a 'deb' backup.

The idea is that reinstalling a computer with only a basic installation and running the restore will result in a system configured the same way as the original system.

This means that the deb-dr will (try) to keep track of all files that are different than the files as provided by the package creator. This way all modifications made should be captured.
The biggest 'issue' that will be covered is keeping track of depening files.

E.g. when using bind as a dns server the location of the zonefiles can be 'anywhere' on the system. The only way to know where they are is by parsing the named.conf and follow the directives.
